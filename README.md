Hilti Quiz-Train
================

 Hilti Quiz-Train is a simple knowledge transfer app developed for The Hilti Mobile App Challenge 2016. App is focused to ease the way knowledge is transferred among the tertiary sales employees of [Hilti corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilti).

## Motivation
  Hilti has a diverse product line with more than 20000 employees and 200000 customer interactions every day. They follow direct sales model. Capturing the qualitative information in each customer interaction is very important to improvise the customer service and in turn improve sales. We came up with a simple idea of quiz where users (tertiary sales man) can utilize this app to learn about a particular product, their complaints and  feedback from customers.
